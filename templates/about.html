    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-text">
        <p>I’m Michael Jolley, an IT Technician III at the SC Department of Motor Vehicles, bringing over six years of experience to the table. I lead major tech rollouts—think branch openings, software implementations, and system upgrades—while also serving as the go-to lead tech for desktop support tools. My knack for hardware maintenance and agency-specific software troubleshooting helps keep everything running smoothly, and I pride myself on tackling even the trickiest technical issues with precision.</p>
        <p>Driven by a passion for technology, I’m always staying ahead of the curve. Certifications like <em>The Complete Cyber Security Course: Hackers Exposed</em> and <em>Automating Administration with Windows PowerShell</em> keep me sharp. Whether I’m troubleshooting servers or configuring networks, I thrive on the challenge. I also enjoy digging into new projects and expanding my knowledge through online courses on Udemy and Coursera.</p>
        <p>Beyond the office, I’ve built an advanced home lab where I sharpen my server skills. Powered by Proxmox and Unraid for virtualization, it’s loaded with Linux and Windows servers, plus a few PC VMs for testing. I dive into real-world simulations like Active Directory management, DNS/DHCP setups, network security tweaks—you name it. It’s my space for mastering virtualization and system management, all to elevate my professional capabilities.</p>
